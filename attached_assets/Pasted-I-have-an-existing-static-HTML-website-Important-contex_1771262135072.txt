I have an existing static HTML website.

Important context:

The website is already hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

The source code is stored in GitHub.

The site is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

I DO NOT want to modify or break any existing pages (index.html, about.html, etc.).

I only want to implement a dynamic publishing system for the /blog section.

The blog pages must follow my existing blog design layout (header, footer, styling must stay consistent).

Your task is to implement a production-ready Git-based CMS blog system using Decap CMS.

Use:
Decap CMS

The system must follow this architecture:

FOLDER STRUCTURE

Create the following structure:

/admin/index.html
/admin/config.yml
/content/blog/
/scripts/generate-blog.js
/blog/
/images/uploads/

Do NOT modify non-blog pages.

ADMIN DASHBOARD

Set up Decap CMS at /admin.

Requirements:

GitHub backend authentication

Store blog posts as Markdown files in /content/blog

Store uploaded images in /images/uploads

Each blog post must include these fields:

Title

Slug

Publish Date

Meta Title

Meta Description

Featured Image

Body (Markdown editor)

CMS must allow non-technical users to publish blogs easily.

BLOG GENERATION SCRIPT

Create /scripts/generate-blog.js.

The script must:

Read all markdown files from /content/blog

Parse frontmatter using gray-matter

Convert markdown body to HTML using marked

Generate static HTML files inside:

/blog/{slug}.html

Each generated blog page must:

Follow my existing blog page layout

Reuse header and footer structure

Keep same CSS classes and design

Include:

<title>metaTitle</title> <meta name="description" content="metaDescription"> <link rel="canonical"> Open Graph tags Proper <h1> Featured image with alt text Semantic HTML structure

Do NOT generate plain basic HTML.
It must match the current site’s styling and layout.

BLOG LISTING PAGE

Update /blog/index.html so that:

It automatically lists all blog posts

Displays:

Featured image

Title

Short excerpt

Read More link to /blog/slug.html

Uses the current blog card design of the website

PACKAGE CONFIGURATION

Create package.json with:

Dependencies:

gray-matter

marked

Scripts:
"build": "node scripts/generate-blog.js"

CLOUDFLARE BUILD SETTINGS

Build command:
npm install && npm run build

Output directory:
/

SEO REQUIREMENTS

Each blog page must:

Be static HTML (not JS rendered)

Have clean URLs

Include meta title and description

Include Open Graph tags

Use proper heading structure

Be optimized for SEO performance

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

After generating the system:

Explain clearly:

How I log into /admin

How I publish a new blog post

What happens after I click publish

How Cloudflare deploys it

How the blog appears live on my website

The solution must be clean, production-ready, and not affect existing pages.
